_Opinions, intuition vs solid data.._ 

# "Without data you are just a person with an opinion - W. Edwards Demin"

I used to be an firm advocate of this thinking, I am still learning new skills and techniques to get the qualitative and quantivative data I need to take better informed decisions that are defendible. It gives me confidence I need to prioritize product correctly and it helps me to get the buy in from our stakeholders and work better with our partners.

Like scientists we engineers put a high value on empirical evidence and the data/information when making decisions, it is very cool, I won't deny the satisfaction it gives me to have it. Problem that I perceived, not only in me but in other teams and areas too, is that we tend to believe that data it will solve all problems and unfortunately..

- **We tend to undermine intuition and avoid tension, emotions** ( this are present usually in teams conformed of human beings) that are part of any creative decision process to a level which they had zero relevance in conversions and they are considered irrelevant or even awkward.
- **And also we delay too much any type of decision because lack of data**: The world is moving, sometimes is worse to stand still than to move forward. Actually I feel inspired and try to apply something similar to [the Jeff Bezzos reasoning on decisions](https://fs.blog/2018/04/reversible-irreversible-decisions/) which basically consists in asses decisions based on perceived risk.

# "Without an opinion you are just another person with data"

And don't get me wrong, I still believe that data is a very powerful thing and that it's correct usage can lead to better product decisions, is just that I don't leave intution/opinions out of the ecuation, they are valuable and depending on the context they can be the biggest starting point when there is uncertainty, I don't threat them as the truth but as an *hypothesis* that's worth validating.
