_Hardest thing of product development is not building the product, but building the right product_ 

# Ask Ask Ask

When creating products or new features for an existing one I've experienced

* The industry is moving in that direction. 
* It has capabilities that they don't have today anywhere.

# With no buy in and no validation the trouble comes

It is naive to belive that users will just adopt your solution for the reasons explained above, truth is the market (internal/external customers) is hard and if a need is not being solved (or solved better) they simply will not use it, and if they somehow are forced, results of this will be seen in customer satisfaction.

Remember that at the end of the day we are building products for other people to make their lives better.
