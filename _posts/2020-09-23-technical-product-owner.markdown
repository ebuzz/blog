_Having a technical background has it's advantages, and no, it is not about coding the solution together with the team, nor giving them the implementation we desire._ 

# Can understand (better) Development Team concerns regarding technical decisions

When building Product, understanding those details about the solution (even if just a little) makes a huge difference, by understanding what's behind the solution at any level the product guys on the team can either contribute to conversation, facilitate it or simply get out of the way if needed.

# Can understand (better) complexity of Development Team estimations

Software estimation is hard, and sometimes I see PMs question too much the estimations of a team and try to negotiate a "small estimation" (ah  deadlines!) because they don't really understand the implications that are being taken into account, leading into long conversations that are not really helpful for anyone. How to we expect people to trust us if we don't trust their judgement?

 Comprehending this side of things not only helps to create a healthier relationship but enables us to support better the team, I see this knowledge useful specially in those situations when a solution is too complex that our skills can help us to frame the problem even more so we can get same or more value for less effort.

# Can understand (better) the implications of the trade offs that are made for the Product
To meet our commitments and provide value to our customers sometimes we have to make trade offs, from "we may have to leave that feature out of the scope of the release to get more users for our first round" or "probabily doing quick this time will make a huge difference to gain market advantage" You name it.

But like everyday life, every decision comes with a risk and really understanding the costs of this decisions can help you to the visualize possible outcomes (good or bad).

# Conclusion
Could previous three points mentioned here be accomplished without technical background? I am pretty sure it is possible, but why miss the opportunity to learn more about your product and connect more with your development teamates?

**It's all about empathy, don't do this please :)**
