_Hardest thing of product development is not building the product, but building the right product_ 

# "Without data you are just a person with an opinion"

I used to be an firm advocate of this thinking(quote by W. Edwards Deming), I am still learning new skills and techniques to get the qualitative and quantivative data I need to take better informed decisions that are defendible (learning a couple of new techniques now). It gives me confidence I need to prioritize product correctly and it helps me to get the buy in from our partners.

Like scientists we engineers put a high value on empirical evidence and the data/information when making decisions, it is very cool. Problem that I perceived, not only in me but in other teams too, is that we tend to believethat  it will solve all problems and..

- **We undermine tension, intuition, emotions** ( which are present in teams conformed of human beings) to a level which they had zero relevance in our conversions because they are considered irrelevant and try to avoid. 
- **We delay too much decisions because lack of data**: The world is moving, sometimes is worse to stand still than to move forward. Prioritizing product I learned the hard way that not all the data I need will be always available to have 100% confidence on my choices.



# Without an opinion you are just another person with data

And don't get me wrong, I still believe that data is a very powerful thing and that it's correct usage can lead to better product decisions, is just that I don't leave intution/opinions out of the ecuation, they are valuable and depending on the context they can be the biggest starting point when there is uncertainty, I don't threat them as the truth but as an *hypothesis* that's worth validating.
