_Trainee, internship_ 

# Background
Being a former software development intern and now an employee with more /*experience*/ I now get some struggles that some of share when we just started our professional career. Having now the opportunity to work with amazing young people in the team there are three things I always procure to share with them:

# Ask Ask Ask

Have questions? Do not know how to proceed with that approach? Don't hold yourself and speak up.
You are here for learning and just starting your career, ask as many questions as you need to your team.

You'll think they know everything but guess what, they don't.

# Make mistakes, take big challenges

Don't be afraid to take the hard work. If the team has assigned you hard work is because they think you can take it and if you have questions or need help raise your hand, no one is going to give you the evil eye for that.

# Speak up

You are part of the team, don't be shy to express your opinion about that design or a decision that is going be taken about an specific approach, your voice has value and we'd like to know what you think.


Just wanted to share this, thanks for reading be safe.
