# Background
When I landed to this Product Management position that was the first question I asked myself, prioritazation can be done in many ways;  experience, product maturity, stakeholder involvement, target users are some of the key factors that come into play when choosing one approach or the other. During my short but well-lived career, Iâ€™ve tried different approaches and I've measured the results of each of them, let me share them with you.

*Context:*
- I work with Product Teams that support internal Products that are in active development, this team also supports the users and helps them with troubleshooting.
- Our customers are the internal leadership team in our org who has a vision for our internal product group.
- Our users are all developers in the organization located in different regions across the globe.

# Our Business and Users as starting line

Our organization **business** leaders created our group with different objectives in mind, so they are our sponsors and they are the ones making the last desicions. Whatever we create has to support their objectives.

Our **users** are the the best source of problems to be solved, they are the ones that have the needs that with our expertise we can solve.

**Business**

- **Vision**
Without vision we do not know where are we going and what do we want to accomplish with all the work we do. When in doubt if something should be done or not always remember the vision that was set. 
- **Goals**
The business has goals as organization, in discussions we agree how are going to accomplish these goals in a way that we can make progress incrementally and show results to anyone interested, to make it easier we break down big goals into quarters goals and bi-weekly goals (the sprint goal). Unlike the vision this is not broad and we are able to deliver something tangible.

**Users**


- **User Interviews**
The objective of these sessions is to get our users to talk about their problems regarding specific topics, for this I involved team members of Product Team that is owner of the Product. We defined some guidelines to run effective User Interviews so we can get the best of these sessions. It has gave us better insights of the current pain points of users and has made us realign our efforts to solve them.
Since this is one of the most recent activities we started doing I will create another post for this.
- **Dedicated chat group**
We came up with a support channel where users can not only ask for support but clarify questions or give suggestions related to the Products we support. This group is very active and very resourceful for those who want fast answers.
- **Internal Forum**
Downside of chat threats is that with the time they get lost, discussion forum has become a great tool for our team as everyone engages in conversations and anyone running into similar problems can just take a look at previos posts anytime.
- **Ticketing system**
Our company uses a ticketing system for support activities, since we started working on our products we not only solve the request but use the requests as opportunies for automation.
- **Mail**
Email is still a good communication channel for some of our users where they can express in detail what is the need that they have.




Well, that's all, thanks for reading.
