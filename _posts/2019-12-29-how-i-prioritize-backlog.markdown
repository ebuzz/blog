# Background
When i landed to this Product Management position that was the first question i asked myself, you can prioritize the work you do in many ways; your experience, product maturity, stakeholder involvement, even target users are some of the key factors that come into play when choosing one approach or the other. During my short but well lived career i've tried different approaches and measure the effectiveness of each of of them.

*Context:*
- I work with Product Teams that support internal Products that are in active development, this team also supports the users and helps them with troubleshooting.
- Our customers are the internal leadership team in our org who has a vision for our internal product group.
- Our users are all developers in the organization located in different regions across the globe.

# Use your Business and our Users to prioritize

The feedback from our users is critical to deliver the best product that fits our users needs, here we are looking for problems to solve. I'll list the ones i use at this moment from more important to less important.

**Users**


- **User Interviews**
The objective of these sessions is to get our users to talk about their problems regarding an specific topics, for this i involve part of the Product Team that is owner of the Product for it to be succesfull i involved the rest of Product Team, 
- **Dedicated chat group**
We came up with a support channel where users can not only ask for support but clarify questions or give suggestions related to the Products we support.
- **Internal Forum**
Downside of chat threats is that with the time they get lost, discussion forum has become a great tool for our team as everyone engages in conversations and anyone running into similar problems can just take a look at previos posts anytime.
- **Ticketing system**
Our company uses a ticketing system for support activities, since we started working on our products we not only solve the request but use the requests as opportunies for automation.
- **Mail**
Email is still a good communication channel for some of our users where they can express in detail what is the need that they have.
