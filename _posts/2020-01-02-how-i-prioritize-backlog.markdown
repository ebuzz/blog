_Disclaimer: First post, expect to see areas of improvements :D_ 

# Background
When I landed to this _Product Management_ position that was the first question I asked myself, I read and I read, with the time I found out that prioritization can be done in many ways, and things like my experience as PO, product maturity, how well did I know my stakeholders, who my users were, played a key role when choosing one approach or the other. I won't talk to you about prioritization frameworks, there are many good posts out there if you want to check them out, I'll just share two aspects that you I think you should never lose of sight when prioritizng, hoping that this helps someone.

**_Context:_**
- I work with Product Teams that support internal Products that are in active development, this team also supports the users and helps them with troubleshooting.
- The internal leadership team in our orgazation created our group to increase things like productivity.
- All developers in the organization located in different regions across the globe use our products.

# Answer: I use our Business and Users to prioritize

It may be obvious for some people but it is not, I've seen how prioritization is done without it in a lot of places without taking into account this two pillars.

**Why the Business and How?**

Our organization **business** leaders created our group to support the goals they have as a business, they are our sponsors and they are the ones making the last decisions about our existence. Fair enough right? 

There are two things you can get or create with your business leaders.

- **Our business _Vision_**
This is not just a soft statement, the vision tells us where do we want to go, how we are going to make the world better, creating one with your business partners will not only align expectations in the first place but gives you the ownership you need for every decision you take.
- **Our business _Goals_**
Getting clarity on the business goals has helped us to prioritize better, where do we want to be in 3, 6 or 12 months? Together with your business leaders define what success looks like and how are you going to measure it, everyone wants to see progress. 

**Why the Users and How?**

Our **users** are the best source of problems to be solved, they are the ones that have the needs that with our expertise we can solve. Their feedback has helped us to continue with our plans or discard them and start over. Even solving a support request can give us the information we need to come with better solutions.  The following are some of the channels I've used to get their input:

- **User Interviews**
The objective of these sessions is to get our users to talk about their problems regarding specific topics **they don't tell us what features to build**, for this I involve the Product Team that is the owner of the Product. We defined some guidelines to run effective User Interviews so we can get the best of these sessions. 
So far it has provided us better insights into the current pain points of users and has made us realign our efforts to solve them.
- **Dedicated chat group**
We came up with a support channel where users can not only ask for support but clarify questions or give suggestions related to the Products we support. This group is very active and very resourceful for those who want fast answers. 
- **Internal Forum**
The downside of chat is that with the time conversations get lost, the discussion forum has become a great tool for our team as everyone that uses our product engages in conversations and anyone running into similar problems can just take a look at previous posts anytime.
- **Ticketing system**
Our company uses a ticketing system for support activities, we not only solve the request but use the requests as opportunities for automation and these go directly into our backlog.
- **Mail** 
Email has been very useful for us, our users express in detail what is the need that they have or as a first contact mechanism to adopt what we offer.





Well that's it, really hope contents above are useful, i will be getting better over time.
