_If you can't measure you can't improve it :D_ 

# Background
Couple of months later after I started my role as Product Owner, I had the opportunity to present to company executives team how our team was doing, the dynamic was simple, each Product Team in our organization was scheduled a 5-10 minute session with them, and they were going to review our Team Metrics (which we pulled from JIRA).

I was kind of nervous of what they may ask, in my head I questioned myself if they were going to question my work? Maybe the work peace of my team? That sprint we did pure research on that new technologhy we did not know anything about, and also the reason our original plan was delayed? Cheez!

After sessions started, I noticed a pattern during the sessions, they barely looked at the metrics we presented, they wanted to hear more abut our own story and they asked different questions about our product, our customers, the impact and how they could help. Some of them were able to provide that info, others not.

# Some of the questions they asked

- What's the revenue we will get by launching this feature?
- How many people did this initiative reached?
- How much money did we save by implementing this?
- Did it increased productivity? How much?

# What they did not ask at all

- How many *business points* or *story points* the Product Team was able to do in one quarter.
- Why the test coverage report shows 85% instead of 90%
- Why the Product Team completed 70 stories when they originally planned 90.
- Why Product Team velocity has not seen a great increase since last quarter.

# Lessons learned
- Executives don't have time to go through spreadsheets to review numbers.
- And most important, they care about the impact you make on the **business** and the **customers** you serve.
